We introduce PutnamBench, a benchmark for evaluation of theorem proving algorithms on competition mathematics problems sourced from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. Our formalizations currently support three formal languages : Lean 4, Isabelle, and Coq. Every problem has a formalization for Lean and Isabelle, while Coq currently contains a subset due to unique formalization challenges present from accessible Coq mathematical repositories.
