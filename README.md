# PutnamBench

PutnamBench is a benchmark for evaluation of theorem proving algorithms on competition mathematics problems sourced from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition years 1965 - 2023. Our formalizations currently support three formal languages : Lean 4 $\land$ Isabelle $\land$ Coq. PutnamBench comprises of over 1300 manual formalizations, aggregated over all languages.

PutnamBench aims to support research in automated mathematical reasoning by providing a multilingual benchmark for evaluating theorem-proving algorithms. It is released under permissive licenses (Apache 2.0 for Lean 4 and Isabelle, MIT for Coq), and we encourage community contributions (TODO: After initial release)
